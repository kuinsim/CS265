1.1
Defining "TRUE" as 0 and "FALSE" as 1 does not make sense since usually 0 is interpreted as false and anything else is true. Also, It would make more sense if "not_eof = FALSE" was changed to "is_eof = TRUE".

1.2
I would rename "smaller" to "isSmaller" since it returns 1 or 0, or TRUE or FALSE.

1.3
The variables in falloc are too hard to read and would make more sense if they were shorter, if the capital letters were used to stand for something instead of have the entire name capitalized, or if there were more vowels.

1.4
if ( ( c != 'y' ) && ( c != 'Y' ) )
	return;

if ( length > BUFSIZE )
	length = BUFSIZE;

flag = !flag;

quote = (*line == '"');

bit = val & 1;

1.5
The order that the read methods are called is not the same as the order that they are listed.

1.6
1 2
2 1
1 1

if (!isatty(stdin) && !isatty(stdout) && !isatty(stderr))
    return 0;

return retval;

for (k = 0; k < 5; k++) {
    scanf("%lf", &dx);
    x += dx;
}
k++;

1.8
for (int i = 0; i < total; i++) {
    if (this.getName(i) == nameTable.userName()) {
        return true;
    }
}

1.9
#define ISDIGIT(c) ((c) >= '0' && (c) <= '9')

1.11
For the first section, the function is void so it will not return anything. For the second section, the if statement tests if n > MAX or if n is odd, not test for even number. For the third section, the // Write a message comment is not needed since the function name is write_message and the // Add to line counter for each line written comment is unneeded since it is obvious that the line counter will be increased for each line written. For the fourth section, the second // increment line counter is inconsistent with the first since it is incrementing by 2 instead of 1.
