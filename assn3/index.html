<h1>CD Database</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This assignment will give you practise w/user and program interfaces,
and choosing/building useful data structures.</p>

<p>You will maintain a flat-file database, allowing users to query, delete a
entry, create an entry.</p>

<p> You'll also, for some practise, submit a make file. </p>

<hr>
<h2>The Assignment</h2>

<p> Write a command-line utility called <tt><b>cddb</b></tt> to maintain a flat-file database of album information.  You
will allow the user to view album info, add a new entry, or delete an entry, where each entry is an album w/all of the
track information, as follows: </p>

<hr>
<h3> Options, and Descriptions </h3>

<ul>
	<li> <tt><b>-l</b></tt> &#8212; List album
		<ol>
			<li> Display an enumerated, alphabetical list of artists<sup>&#0134;</sup> </li>
			<li> You will allow the user to choose an artist by entering the number, or to quit by entering a
				<tt><b>q</b></tt> </li>
			<li> You will then list all albums, by release date, enumerated </li>
			<li> Allow the user to choose an album, by #, or return to the menu above (artists) by entering <tt><b>a</b></tt>
				</li>
			<li> If an album is entered, list all songs in that album, by track order.  Prompt for input to return to the
				previous (i.e., the album) menu </li>
		</ol>
	</li>
	<li> <tt><b>-d</b></tt> &#8212; Delete album.  Similar to above, display
		menus allowing a user to choose an album to delete </li>
	<li> <tt><b>-a</b></tt> &#8212; Add album.  You'll prompt for artist, album name, release date, and finally the track
		list.  You may assume that they are entered in track order.<br/> You'll want to check that the album doesn't already
		exist before adding it </li>
	<li> <tt><b>-h</b></tt> &#8212; Show usage msg and quit </li>
</ul>

<p> <sup>&#0134;</sup>You may assume that all names are entered exactly.  That is, do not worry about inconsistencies in
spelling or capitalisation.  E.g., <i>Led Zeppelin</i>, <i>LedZeppelin</i>, and <i>led zeppelin</i> are 3 different
groups for this assignment. </p>

<p> If no argument is supplied, a bad argument is supplied, or multiple arguments, print a usage message and exit. </p>

<hr>
<h3>File Format</h3>

<p> Album information will be stored in a flat file w/the format shown in <a
	href='sample.db'>sample.db</a>: </p>

<iframe src='sample.db' width='90%' scrolling='yes' height='400'></iframe>

<p> To simplify things, the filename (location of the DB) will be stored in an exported environment variable,
<tt><b>$CDDB</b></tt> . </p>


<hr>
<h2> Target Language </h2>

<p> You will do this in Python3. </p>

<hr>
<a name='alg'><h2> Hints (maybe) </h2></a>

<ul>
	<li> I'd create some data structure to represent an album </li>
	<li> Store albums in a dictonary, keyed by artist </li>
	<li> When updating the DB (writing the new file out), write to a temporary file.  If this is successful, rename it
		appropriately.  This is generally an atomic operation.  So, if something bad happens w/your program, or the power
		grid, etc., you don't blow your DB up </li>
</ul>

<hr>
<h2> Submission </h2>

<p> Submit the following files: </p>

<ul>
	<li> <tt><b>cddb</b></tt> &mdash; Your top-level Python script
	<li> <tt><b>Makefile</b></tt> &mdash; your makefile, with the folowing targets:
		<ul>
			<li> <tt>clean</tt> &mdash; cleans up all intermediate and resulting
				files and directories (if any) </li>
			<li> <tt>view</tt> &mdash; display any source code that you wrote, in
				a pager </li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li> Any other needed (Python) files </li>
	<li> <tt><b>README</b></tt> <i>optional</i> &mdash; anything you want to say to
		me before I grade.</li>
</ul>
